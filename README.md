  # Sorry: üôäüôäüôä
  </summary>

Sorry for the inconvenience! The reason is due to our busyness; the versions have progressed too far, and we couldn't update the details. We will summarize as follows:

The current version has a provider.
The current version is using an API from hosting, with the backend utilizing ASP.NET Web API + Swagger GUI.
If you open our source code, you can see all the security information such as username/password, as well as our domain and endpoint. They are not secured.
In our next version, we will reorganize the source so that the API can use localhost. You can download the backend using MongoDB, which we will provide later.
Regarding the App's progress:
You can open the home page and click on any product to see details (only the product ID is displayed, the other information is fixed).

We will update it as soon as possible! Thank you
